Q1: What is the conversion rate for control and treatment groups?

SELECT 
  group, 
  COUNT(*) AS total_users,
  SUM(converted) AS total_converted,
  ROUND(SUM(converted) * 1.0 / COUNT(*), 4) AS conversion_rate
FROM ab_data
GROUP BY group;

Answer:

Control: ~12.04%
Treatment: ~11.88%
(Control group slightly outperformed treatment)

Q2: Which days of the week have the highest conversion rates?
SELECT 
  day_of_week,
  ROUND(AVG(converted), 4) AS avg_conversion_rate
FROM ab_data
GROUP BY day_of_week
ORDER BY avg_conversion_rate DESC;

Answer:
Highest conversion on: Sunday, Monday, Tuesday
(These might be good days to test new versions)

Q3: At what hours are users most likely to convert?
SELECT 
  hour,
  ROUND(AVG(converted), 4) AS avg_conversion_rate
FROM ab_data
GROUP BY hour
ORDER BY avg_conversion_rate DESC;

Answer:
Peak conversion hours: Between 11 AM â€“ 1 PM and around 9 PM


Q4: How does daily conversion distribution vary between control and treatment?

SELECT 
  date, 
  group,
  ROUND(AVG(converted), 4) AS daily_conversion_rate
FROM ab_data
GROUP BY date, group
ORDER BY date;

Answer:

Both groups show similar distribution. Treatment slightly underperforms on average, with occasional spikes.


Q5: Are there any anomalies or spikes in daily conversion rates?

SELECT 
  date, 
  ROUND(AVG(converted), 4) AS conversion_rate
FROM ab_data
GROUP BY date
ORDER BY conversion_rate DESC
LIMIT 5;

Answer:

A few dates show conversion rates above 15%, which could be outliers or influenced by promotions or random variation.

Q6: Are the user counts balanced between groups each day?

SELECT 
  date,
  SUM(CASE WHEN group = 'control' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS control_users,
  SUM(CASE WHEN group = 'treatment' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS treatment_users
FROM ab_data
GROUP BY date
ORDER BY date;

Answer:

Yes, both groups are generally well-balanced, which makes the test fair.

Q7: Are there specific hours/days where treatment performs significantly better or worse?

SELECT 
  day_of_week,
  hour,
  ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN group = 'control' THEN converted END), 4) AS control_conversion,
  ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN group = 'treatment' THEN converted END), 4) AS treatment_conversion,
  ROUND(
    AVG(CASE WHEN group = 'treatment' THEN converted END) - 
    AVG(CASE WHEN group = 'control' THEN converted END), 4
  ) AS diff
FROM ab_data
GROUP BY day_of_week, hour
ORDER BY diff DESC;

Answer:
Some hours like Tuesday 10 AM or Thursday 8 PM show treatment group outperforming, but no consistent pattern overall.
